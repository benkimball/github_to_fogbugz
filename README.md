# GithubToFogbugz

Imports GitHub issues into FogBugz On Demand.

Wraps the GitHub and FogBugz APIs to copy issues from GitHub and insert them as new cases in FogBugz. Probably very fragile, and fairly customized for my specific use case, but may be helpful to those looking for a starting place.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'github_to_fogbugz'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install github_to_fogbugz

## Usage

Not exactly sure yet.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
